To use the VPN application, you will need access to an Orchid account. The Orchid accounts hold the funds that pay providers through the nanopayment system and users are responsible for managing those accounts on the blockchain. Each account has its own public/private keypair, a special funder wallet that can control the account and the account makeup (deposit & balance), which determines how efficient the account is at transmitting payments. How to get an Orchid account Purchase an account (iOS/macOS/Android only feature) custodied by Orchid Create and self-custody an Orchid account using the Orchid dApp Access an account that was shared with you Purchased Orchid accounts (iOS/macOS/Android) In the Orchid Android, iOS and macOS apps, it is possible to simply purchase an Orchid account from Orchid Labs using an in-app purchase. These are distinct from Orchid accounts created in the dApp and have the following properties: Purchased accounts connect only to preferred providers for VPN service. It is not possible to transfer the crypto out of a purchased Orchid account in the same way as an account created in the dApp. Accounts are created on the xDai blockchain and are denominated in the XDAI stablecoin. Orchid takes your in-app purchase funds and adds the equivalent XDAI to the selected Orchid address on the xDai blockchain. Your balance and deposit will increase by the amount of USD purchased. Orchid account efficiency Orchid\u2019s nanopayments work on a principle: that sending someone a scratch lottery ticket with a 1/100 chance of winning $100 instead of sending $1 will save you transaction fees and transmit the same amount of value over time. The amount of value transmitted per \u201cwinning\u201d ticket divided by the fees gives the account\u2019s efficiency which is displayed in the app and dApp. When the efficiency of an account drops below 0%, providers will no longer accept payments from that account because the network fees are greater than the amount of value they could receive from a winning ticket. Accounts with 0% efficiency will not work with the VPN service and will warn the user with a red \u201c!\u201d. There are three major factors that affect efficiency: The size of the deposit of the account which determines the face value of the tickets The network fees for a given moment in time Currency conversion of the currency held in the account to the currency used to pay network fees Efficiency example Imagine an Orchid account with a 150 OXT deposit. The account will issue tickets with a 75 OXT face value. Providers therefore are getting a tiny chance at \u201cwinning\u201d 75 OXT for each ticket they accept for service. Providers must pay the network fee to claim the 75 OXT. Since the OXT denominated account is on Ethereum, the network fees are paid in ETH. So the provider calculates the current ETH gas price in OXT and makes sure that the fee is not greater than 75 OXT. When the network fees the provider pays to claim the 75 OXT are greater than 75 OXT of value, the provider does not accept payments from that account and that account has a 0% efficiency. Deposit The deposit is required to accept service and is verified by providers. The deposit prevents double spending and in general, the deposit maintains good standing on the network. The size of the deposit determines the face value of the tickets sent from the user to the provider. The face value refers to the amount of OXT that a provider claims when they receive a winning off-chain nanopayment. Currently the face value is set to equal half of the deposit. When an Orchid account is created, the deposit is \u201clocked\u201d and cannot be withdrawn from the account until it is \u201cunlocked\u201d and a 24-hr cooling period has passed. Size of Deposit Market conditions are constantly changing. This includes fluctuations in network fees (Ethereum gas amounts) and changes in the conversion rate from the currency held in the account to the currency to pay network fees (OXT -> ETH). When the account efficiency gets low, it is a good idea to add additional OXT to the deposit of the account to increase the efficiency. The dApp has an efficiency slider that displays the amount of deposit necessary to achieve that efficiency. Increasing the size of the deposit increases the efficiency of the account by increasing the face value of the tickets. Balance The balance portion of the Orchid account is the amount of currency held to pay providers. When the account is in use, the tickets are backed by funds in the balance. When a ticket \u201cwins\u201d, the face value of the ticket is withdrawn from the user\u2019s account balance and deposited into the provider\u2019s account with an on-chain transaction. As a practical matter, while using the Orchid VPN, you will notice that the balance remains unchanged for long periods of time. That is because you can often receive significant amounts of bandwidth, on average, before a payment ticket \u201cwins\u201d, funds are claimed and your balance is adjusted. The balance of an Orchid account can be thought of as a number of tickets. The size of the ticket is governed by the deposit, as the network requires two tickets worth of deposit for payments to be accepted. The two tickets worth of deposit is required to prevent double spending attacks. So for example, if the account\u2019s deposit size is 150 OXT and there is 225 OXT in the balance, the Orchid account has 3 tickets worth of balance because the size of each ticket is 75 OXT (deposit / 2) and there are 3 tickets worth of balance (total balance / ticket size). The dApp has an Add Funds screen to add additional balance to your account. Tickets A ticket is a nanopayment sent from a user to a provider to pay for service. The ticket has a probability of winning along with a face value, which is the amount of currency the provider receives if the ticket \u201cwins\u201d. The face value of a ticket is set at half of the deposit in the Orchid account. While this is hard coded in the app right now, in the future the face value of tickets could vary, depending on market conditions and to optimize for variance. However, the upper limit of ticket size is governed by the deposit, and the max ticket size is always half of the deposit. Orchid accounts with very few tickets will experience a high amount of variance due to the nature of probability. Variance There is an important concept to consider when using Orchid -- variance. Since tickets have a probability of a win, it is likely that a winning ticket will be claimed either faster or slower than is expected. For a quick example, imagine you have an Orchid account with one ticket worth of balance. As you start using the service, a winning ticket is issued immediately because you are \u201cunlucky\u201d. Your balance then goes to 0 and you will need to add funds. This is an example of not getting what you expect due to variance. The inverse can also happen: that is to receive much more service than expected. To combat variance, Orchid accounts need more tickets worth of service. That way, the probability of a winning ticket being issued before or after you would expect is mitigated. As of now, Orchid recommends at least 3 tickets worth of service in your account balance. Technical Parts of an Orchid account The makeup of an Orchid account is important for understanding how to manage it, and how the different components work together. Ultimately the technical details of the account are dictated by the nanopayment smart contract which holds the funds and allows users to interact with their accounts. The Orchid funder wallet The funder wallet is a block-chain address that corresponds to the wallet address that funded the account. The owner of that wallet has complete control over the Orchid account and can add or remove funds, along with all the other operations available in the Orchid account manager. Simply put, the funder wallet is the custodian of the Orchid account. Without the keys to the funder wallet, no functions can be performed on the account, such as adding/removing funds, unlocking/locking the deposit and moving funds between balance and deposit. If the keys to a funder wallet are lost, the associated Orchid account will still function, but the user cannot add funds, remove funds or make any changes to the account. You will be able to use the account while it\u2019s efficiency is above 0%, until the balance is reduced to 0. If the deposit is lost and if the account efficiency drops below 0%, there is no way to add to the deposit. The Orchid Address & Key Orchid accounts utilize their own keypair. The private portion of the key or \u201csecret\u201d is used by the client to sign tickets. The key is therefore a core technical property of the Orchid account and is the important bit of information that is shared when an Orchid account is shared between people or devices. The public portion of the keypair is the address which is used when funding the Orchid account. The funding transaction that takes funds from the funder wallet and into the nanopayment contract requires the funds to be linked to an Orchid address. In the Orchid dApp, the address is required before a new Orchid account can be created \u2013 you can copy your Orchid Address in the latest version of the app and paste that in the signer address field in the dApp to create an account. The keypair is generated in the app. To create a new keypair, go to the Manage Accounts->Gear Icon->New. The Orchid address will be displayed next to an identicon and can be copied over to be used by the dApp to add an orchid account to this address. The key can be exported using the gear icon and saved and will have access to any accounts with that address. Sharing Orchid accounts There\u2019s no limit to the number of people or devices that a single Orchid account can be shared with. The account is specified by the funder wallet and the signer secret. To share an account, you can click the cog wheel next to Orchid Address and then 'export.' A QR code encoding this information with a copy button will appear feature. The account information can also be copied and directly pasted into the client app as text. The Orchid account format looks like this: account={ secret: \" \" } Orchid Account Troubleshooting Deposit size too small Both the Orchid client app and the Orchid web dApp will display a warning when the Orchid account efficiency or balance is too low for usage. There are a few solutions when you see this error. For in-app purchased accounts (iOS/macOS only feature) Tap on the warning to go into the selected account. Simply Add Credit to the account to increase the balance and deposit with a purchase. Do not try to fix purchased accounts in the dApp, manage purchased accounts using in-app purchases only in the app. For Orchid accounts created with the DApp The Orchid dApp can add funds to the account\u2019s deposit, which will improve the Orchid account efficiency and eliminate the warning, allowing the app to start working. To add funds, connect the funder wallet used to create the Orchid account and click on the Add Funds tab. What is the difference between Balance and Deposit in my Orchid Account? The balance is the collateral for the tickets sent from the user to the provider. Over time, as winning tickets are issued from your Orchid app, the Orchid account balance will drop. The deposit is the Orchid token held in escrow to disincentivize double spending on the network. This amount never depletes and can be withdrawn after a 24hr \"unlock\" period.","title":"Orchid Accounts"},{"location":"accounts/#orchid-accounts","text":"","title":"Orchid Accounts"},{"location":"accounts/#what-are-accounts","text":"Orchid accounts are the center of the payment system that allows Orchid\u2019s decentralized VPN application to function.

Basic Internet connections function by transmitting packets of data between two hosts (computers). In order to find their way, packets contain both a source and destination IP address. As packets move from the destination to the source, different routers and physical infrastructure require both of these addresses for the two-way connection to be established and maintained. This means that instantly and over time, the owners of the physical infrastructure are in a position to build a profile of Internet usage on their paying user (you!) and also to block content as the owner sees fit. Typically these infrastructure owners are ISPs \u2014 mobile carriers providing phone data connections, home cable Internet providers, WiFi hotspot operators, and any Internet backbone operators that have peering agreements with user-facing ISPs. In all these cases, the ISP is in an advantaged position to monitor and/or restrict Internet usage. It is common in many countries for ISPs to restrict content so that users cannot load certain websites. If you are not happy with or do not trust your existing ISP(s), by using Orchid you can currently limit their knowledge to knowing only that you are sending and receiving bytes through Orchid, and completely block their ability to mess with the details of your traffic, unblocking the previously blocked content. They either block all of Orchid or nothing, so if things continue to work after turning on Orchid, then your ISP has allowed \"Orchid in general\" and cannot manipulate the individual bytes between you and the rest of the Internet, granting you access to the entire Internet. How can the Orchid app help me with privacy today? The goal with the Orchid app is to give users insight and control over the network connection of their device. To gain privacy, users configure a circuit in Orchid by setting up an Orchid account and funding it with OXT. Then the Orchid app connects to the Orchid network and selects a node using Orchid\u2019s linear stake-weighted algorithm to serve as a VPN and pays for bandwidth via a continuous stream of tiny OXT nanopayments . In a single-hop circuit configuration, Orchid provides: Protection from websites seeing your real IP address and physical location Protection from your ISP seeing what websites you are visiting and when Access to the open Internet--once a user can connect to Orchid, they are not restricted by ISP level firewalls and can browse the entire Internet freely A potential problem with using only a single VPN provider is that the provider running the single node circuit knows both your IP address and the content you are accessing. If the provider maintains logs, those logs could be sold to advertisers or otherwise used against you. In the current VPN marketplace, it is hard to know who is maintaining logs and who is not. For Orchid nodes, we have developed a flexible curation system that gives users a way to pick whom to trust. Another solution is to trust no single provider with enough information to know both who you are and what information you are accessing. To that end, Orchid supports an advanced feature that allows users to configure multi-hop routes by stringing together multiple nodes into a flexible multi-hop circuit. Orchid currently supports several underlying protocols including the native Orchid VPN protocol and OpenVPN, allowing users to mix and match Orchid nodes with traditional VPN nodes. While the potential is there to protect the user from any one provider knowing enough information to reveal their circuit, this is an advanced feature that is currently \"use at your own risk\". How is Orchid private given that it has public payments on a blockchain? The Orchid app pays for the circuit by sending a continuous stream of tiny nanopayments to providers for the duration of the connection. While the nanopayment architecture locks user funds into a smart contract and--very rarely--winning tickets result in macro-payments posted on the blockchain where the account exists. When that happens, the user\u2019s address, the provider\u2019s address, and a timestamp are stored publically on the blockchain. Note that the payment address of the provider is not a mapping to any single server; instead it is an arbitrary (and potentially temporary) payment address that the provider created specifically to receive funds. Also, the frequency of how often on-chain payments occur is configurable by the user. All information gained by a potential network attacker is an advantage. However, consider exactly what information is revealed. For an Orchid user running a single hop circuit: the provider sees the user\u2019s payment address when it accepts service, along with the user\u2019s real IP address and the destination addresses that the user is connecting to (if it maintains logs). Once a rare on-chain payment is made, the user\u2019s payment address and provider\u2019s payment address are stored on the blockchain with a timestamp available to the public. When considering anonymity, it is important to understand if the user is linked to the crypto used in their circuit. Worst case, if the user purchased the crypto used to fund the account on an exchange with their real identity, or the VPN provider used in the circuit maintained logs, then either of those two entities could be compelled to give information that could deanonymize the user. Similarly, a user who paid for a traditional 0VPN service that maintained logs with a credit card could be deanonymized with just one entity being compelled. A multi-hop circuit affords greater network protections, but to setup a multi-hop Orchid circuit, it would be naive to pay for each hop from the same Ethereum wallet. In that configuration, each provider would be able to see that wallet\u2019s address and potentially use that address to get information about the user. To mitigate that, a better way to setup multi-hop circuits would be to use different wallet addresses for each Orchid hop. If every wallet address is independently dissociated from the user, the full circuit might be quite difficult to link back to the user. Again, multi-hop circuits in Orchid are an advanced feature; use at your own risk. Can Orchid nodes monitor network traffic? Yes, providers on Orchid could monitor the bytes that come in and out of the Orchid node. However, all traffic carried over Orchid between hops from the user to the exit is encrypted at the Orchid protocol level, which is an additional layer of encryption. The final exit traffic is then decrypted by the exit node and sent to the destination. In many cases the underlying traffic will also be encrypted with protocols such as TLS, providing at least two layers of encryption. However, not all traffic on the Internet is encrypted and Orchid doesn\u2019t fix that problem. The last hop configured in the active circuit will need to send the user requests out onto the Internet. So if the user sends an HTTP request, which has no SSL/TLS encryption, Orchid will honor that request and cleartext information would be revealed to the Orchid node. For this reason, you should always use SSL/TLS for sensitive Internet connections, even on Orchid. And even SSL/TLS encryption leaves metadata that the Orchid node could monitor, including the destination address, hostname, packet sizes and the timing of packets. Using Orchid\u2019s multi-hop feature with a three hop circuit would compartmentalize the information any one provider could monitor. With a properly configured multi-hop circuit the origin and destination of the traffic would be anonymized from any one provider, however, that is an advanced feature which is currently \"use at your own risk\". The way the different Orchid hops are funded has an impact on information leakage that could potentially de-anonymize. Lastly, the Orchid client randomly selects from a \"curated list\" of providers. This adds an additional layer of protection as users could pick or make their own curated list of providers that they trust or someone that they trust, trusts. Orchid has a default list of trusted providers that ships with the Orchid app. So I'm totally private and anonymous when I use a VPN like Orchid? No. Orchid is a tool that keeps private certain types of information from ISPs, websites, and providers. Orchid adds layers that separate you from the content you are trying to access. If you login to Amazon, the website will know that it is you and can build out information about what you are doing on their website, even with Orchid enabled. However, your local ISP or network provider will not know you are visiting Amazon. Amazon will not know where you are in the world, and will not get your real IP address. If using at least three hops, no single provider will know your IP address and know that you are accessing Amazon. Also consider that Orchid is a VPN and that all VPNs have vulnerabilities at the software level. Typical modern browsers that are not \"hardened\" run all sorts of \u201cactive content\u201d such as Java, Javascript, Adobe Flash, Adobe Shockwave, QuickTime, RealAudio, ActiveX controls, and VBScript and other binary applications. This code runs at the operating system level with user account access, meaning they can access anything your user account can access. These technologies could store cookies, bypass proxy settings, store other types of data and share information directly to other sites on the Internet. Therefore, these technologies must be disabled in the browser you are using to improve your security in conjunction with using Orchid. Other metadata such as the size of the browser window, type of pointing device used and other unique information could be used to \"fingerprint\" the user and potentially de-anonymize. These browser fingerprinting attacks could affect any VPN users, Orchid included. Hardened browsers can help reduce or eliminate the user\u2019s visible browser fingerprint. Also certain apps or code running on your device could send de-anonymizing data out to the Internet or third parties. No VPN can prevent attacks from arbitrary software running on your device, such as malware or a virus. Furthermore, there is active network security research into \"traffic fingerprinting\" attacks that attempt to reveal private information by monitoring encrypted connections. By watching the timing and size of packets, an adversary monitoring an encrypted connection could get a good idea if a particular user is watching a video, browsing the Internet or downloading a large file, just based on the timing and size of packets. Further analysis could reveal what websites are visited by seeing the sequence of things that are loaded\u2014 again, the timing and size of packets along with when requests are made. Orchid is researching \"bandwidth burning\" and related techniques to help obfuscate a user\u2019s traffic against these advanced packet timing and size analysis attacks. Technology How does the Orchid token (OXT) work? OXT is a \"pre-mined\" cryptocurrency based on the ERC-20 standard that will be used to decentralize trust between buyers and sellers in the Orchid marketplace. It also functions as a tool to promote security and healthy market dynamics, as providers can adjust their OXT stake to remain competitive. Read more about OXT here . How do curated lists work on Orchid? The Orchid client calls an on-chain \u2018curated list\u2019 smart contract which filters the viable nodes on Orchid (that is, nodes that have properly staked) into a custom subset. Initial releases of the official Orchid client will use this feature to prevent certain kinds of attacks from malicious exit nodes (e.g. SSL downgrade attacks) by using a default list consisting of trusted VPN partners. Overall, the curated lists are a federated reputation solution for determining what VPN providers on Orchid you can trust. The system is fully programmable, exists on-chain and is Turing complete. The list function can take information as an argument, and then use that information to determine, for any given Orchid node, whether you want to connect to that node or not. The official Orchid client has a default list and can select from different lists. Eventually we expect well known third parties to emerge as curators. Given that this system is on-chain, an entity such as a DAO could manage a list too. The curated list mechanism is a means for the importation of external reputational trust to supplement the economic incentive based trust provided by node staking. What is the Orchid Protocol? The Orchid software is designed to use a custom VPN protocol, similar in scope to OpenVPN or WireGuard. The Orchid protocol is designed for high-performance networking and runs on top of WebRTC, a common web standard, widely used to transmit video and audio from inside browsers. Our protocol is intended to allow users to request access to remote network resources and pay for these resources using OXT via a nanopayments system. Staking What is Staking in Orchid? Staking is a process where one deposits and locks up an asset into an illiquid contract or mechanism in exchange for revenue or rewards. Orchid providers stake OXT tokens in an Ethereum smart contract (the directory) to advertize their services to clients. Orchid clients then select providers randomly, weighted by proportional stake, so that the probability of picking a particular provider is equal to their fraction of the total stake. Anyone else can also stake on a provider\u2019s address, allowing a form of \"delegated staking\". Any OXT holder can stake their OXT tokens on providers of their choosing. There are no automatic benefits of staking on someone else\u2019s behalf, but the staking mechanism could be combined with a revenue sharing contract between the staker and the stakee. Is Orchid Staking like Proof of Stake? Staking in Orchid is similar to proof of stake systems only in the sense of using stake as a linear weighting mechanism. In most proof-of-stake systems stakeholders can automatically earn revenue just by running nodes with stake. Orchid has no such automatic mechanism, and has no inflation to fund staking. The only source of income on Orchid is customers paying for bandwidth. How can I earn passive revenue on my OXT? You can find an Orchid bandwidth provider who is seeking staking partners in exchange for a share of revenue or recurring payments - using any on-chain or off-chain mechanism. An Ethereum smart contract can be used to help automatically split revenue between a staker and a provider. The staker would stake on the smart contract, and the provider would direct client payments to the smart contract, which would then allow each party to withdraw some parameterized fraction of the funds. Note that any such delegated staking arrangement (even using on-chain mechanisms) can not guarantee that the provider will actually honor the contract: the provider could easily direct clients to a different payment address. And even if the provider is perfectly honest, there is still ultimately uncertainty in revenue and consequent return on stake. As an alternative to revenue sharing, providers could send recurring payments to the staker - essentially a stake rental or leasing arrangement. In this case the return is more predictable, but there is still no guarantee that the provider will make the scheduled payments. Again a smart contract could be used to help automate the payments, but can not guarantee the provider will have the necessary funds. There is always risk. When a staker decides to repoint their stake to a different provider, there is a lengthy withdrawal delay (currently about 3 months). So it is important for stakers to choose providers carefully. Stakers should start with small allocations and slowly increase them based on measured profitability. Eventually third party websites could provide an interface to help simplify and automate the process of finding, evaluating and staking on Orchid bandwidth providers.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#orchid-faq","text":"","title":"Orchid FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#security-and-privacy","text":"","title":"Security and Privacy"},{"location":"faq/#what-protections-does-the-orchid-app-provide","text":"Basic Internet connections function by transmitting packets of data between two hosts (computers). In order to find their way, packets contain both a source and destination IP address. As packets move from the destination to the source, different routers and physical infrastructure require both of these addresses for the two-way connection to be established and maintained. This means that instantly and over time, the owners of the physical infrastructure are in a position to build a profile of Internet usage on their paying user (you!) and also to block content as the owner sees fit. Typically these infrastructure owners are ISPs \u2014 mobile carriers providing phone data connections, home cable Internet providers, WiFi hotspot operators, and any Internet backbone operators that have peering agreements with user-facing ISPs. In all these cases, the ISP is in an advantaged position to monitor and/or restrict Internet usage. It is common in many countries for ISPs to restrict content so that users cannot load certain websites. If you are not happy with or do not trust your existing ISP(s), by using Orchid you can currently limit their knowledge to knowing only that you are sending and receiving bytes through Orchid, and completely block their ability to mess with the details of your traffic, unblocking the previously blocked content. They either block all of Orchid or nothing, so if things continue to work after turning on Orchid, then your ISP has allowed \"Orchid in general\" and cannot manipulate the individual bytes between you and the rest of the Internet, granting you access to the entire Internet.","title":"What protections does the Orchid app provide?"},{"location":"faq/#how-can-the-orchid-app-help-me-with-privacy-today","text":"The goal with the Orchid app is to give users insight and control over the network connection of their device. To gain privacy, users configure a circuit in Orchid by setting up an Orchid account and funding it with OXT. Then the Orchid app connects to the Orchid network and selects a node using Orchid\u2019s linear stake-weighted algorithm to serve as a VPN and pays for bandwidth via a continuous stream of tiny OXT nanopayments . In a single-hop circuit configuration, Orchid provides: Protection from websites seeing your real IP address and physical location Protection from your ISP seeing what websites you are visiting and when Access to the open Internet--once a user can connect to Orchid, they are not restricted by ISP level firewalls and can browse the entire Internet freely A potential problem with using only a single VPN provider is that the provider running the single node circuit knows both your IP address and the content you are accessing. If the provider maintains logs, those logs could be sold to advertisers or otherwise used against you. In the current VPN marketplace, it is hard to know who is maintaining logs and who is not. For Orchid nodes, we have developed a flexible curation system that gives users a way to pick whom to trust. Another solution is to trust no single provider with enough information to know both who you are and what information you are accessing. To that end, Orchid supports an advanced feature that allows users to configure multi-hop routes by stringing together multiple nodes into a flexible multi-hop circuit. Orchid currently supports several underlying protocols including the native Orchid VPN protocol and OpenVPN, allowing users to mix and match Orchid nodes with traditional VPN nodes. While the potential is there to protect the user from any one provider knowing enough information to reveal their circuit, this is an advanced feature that is currently \"use at your own risk\".","title":"How can the Orchid app help me with privacy today?"},{"location":"faq/#how-is-orchid-private-given-that-it-has-public-payments-on-a-blockchain","text":"The Orchid app pays for the circuit by sending a continuous stream of tiny nanopayments to providers for the duration of the connection. While the nanopayment architecture locks user funds into a smart contract and--very rarely--winning tickets result in macro-payments posted on the blockchain where the account exists. When that happens, the user\u2019s address, the provider\u2019s address, and a timestamp are stored publically on the blockchain. Note that the payment address of the provider is not a mapping to any single server; instead it is an arbitrary (and potentially temporary) payment address that the provider created specifically to receive funds. Also, the frequency of how often on-chain payments occur is configurable by the user. All information gained by a potential network attacker is an advantage. However, consider exactly what information is revealed. For an Orchid user running a single hop circuit: the provider sees the user\u2019s payment address when it accepts service, along with the user\u2019s real IP address and the destination addresses that the user is connecting to (if it maintains logs). Once a rare on-chain payment is made, the user\u2019s payment address and provider\u2019s payment address are stored on the blockchain with a timestamp available to the public. When considering anonymity, it is important to understand if the user is linked to the crypto used in their circuit. Worst case, if the user purchased the crypto used to fund the account on an exchange with their real identity, or the VPN provider used in the circuit maintained logs, then either of those two entities could be compelled to give information that could deanonymize the user. Similarly, a user who paid for a traditional 0VPN service that maintained logs with a credit card could be deanonymized with just one entity being compelled. A multi-hop circuit affords greater network protections, but to setup a multi-hop Orchid circuit, it would be naive to pay for each hop from the same Ethereum wallet. In that configuration, each provider would be able to see that wallet\u2019s address and potentially use that address to get information about the user. To mitigate that, a better way to setup multi-hop circuits would be to use different wallet addresses for each Orchid hop. If every wallet address is independently dissociated from the user, the full circuit might be quite difficult to link back to the user. Again, multi-hop circuits in Orchid are an advanced feature; use at your own risk.","title":"How is Orchid private given that it has public payments on a blockchain?"},{"location":"faq/#can-orchid-nodes-monitor-network-traffic","text":"Yes, providers on Orchid could monitor the bytes that come in and out of the Orchid node. However, all traffic carried over Orchid between hops from the user to the exit is encrypted at the Orchid protocol level, which is an additional layer of encryption. The final exit traffic is then decrypted by the exit node and sent to the destination. In many cases the underlying traffic will also be encrypted with protocols such as TLS, providing at least two layers of encryption. However, not all traffic on the Internet is encrypted and Orchid doesn\u2019t fix that problem. The last hop configured in the active circuit will need to send the user requests out onto the Internet. So if the user sends an HTTP request, which has no SSL/TLS encryption, Orchid will honor that request and cleartext information would be revealed to the Orchid node. For this reason, you should always use SSL/TLS for sensitive Internet connections, even on Orchid. And even SSL/TLS encryption leaves metadata that the Orchid node could monitor, including the destination address, hostname, packet sizes and the timing of packets. Using Orchid\u2019s multi-hop feature with a three hop circuit would compartmentalize the information any one provider could monitor. With a properly configured multi-hop circuit the origin and destination of the traffic would be anonymized from any one provider, however, that is an advanced feature which is currently \"use at your own risk\". The way the different Orchid hops are funded has an impact on information leakage that could potentially de-anonymize. Lastly, the Orchid client randomly selects from a \"curated list\" of providers. This adds an additional layer of protection as users could pick or make their own curated list of providers that they trust or someone that they trust, trusts. Orchid has a default list of trusted providers that ships with the Orchid app.","title":"Can Orchid nodes monitor network traffic?"},{"location":"faq/#so-im-totally-private-and-anonymous-when-i-use-a-vpn-like-orchid","text":"No. Orchid is a tool that keeps private certain types of information from ISPs, websites, and providers.

At its core, the dApp is a wrapper for the function calls of the smart contract with UI elements to help users make decisions for account makeup. The dApp interface will ask users to set their efficiency and number of max-sized tickets in their balance, so a familiarity with Orchid accounts is helpful to understand the terminology. Orchid Labs hosts the dApp at account.orchid.com DApp Overview The interface allows users to create and manage multiple Orchid accounts, although for most users only one account is necessary. When arriving at the interface for the first time, the create account screen will display with the controls inactive. Once a wallet is connected, the interface will activate for the Orchid account associated with that wallet. If multiple accounts exist, clicking on the purple Orchid logo at the top right will bring them up so one can be selected. The Add and Withdraw buttons at the top of the interface are how you can add funds or remove them from the selected account. The More tab provides a few more screens for navigation. Info: more details about the selected account Transactions: a list of transactions associated with the attached wallet Move Funds: a function to move funds from balance -> deposit Lock/Unlock Funds: a function to lock or unlock the deposit Advanced: a debugging output screen Connecting a wallet In order to make the dApp active, you will need to attach a funder wallet. The \u201cConnect\u201d button will pop-up your wallet options, depending on whether you are on desktop or mobile, and whether or not a wallet is detected. This step is similar to \u201clogging in\u201d in some sense, as the funder wallet you use to create the account is required to access and manage the account. The key supported wallet connection methods: Load the dApp in a dApp browser, such as MetaMask Mobile or Trust Wallet Use any desktop browser and then connect a mobile wallet with WalletConnect Use a desktop browser with MetaMask enabled as a web3 browser plugin Once the wallet is connected, you will see the address of that wallet displayed as the \u201cfunder wallet\u201d with the funds associated with that wallet appearing next to the address. All of the Orchid accounts created by that funder are available to manage. To disconnect a wallet, click on the purple Orchid logo in the upper right corner. That will pop open a menu with a Disconnect button. Create account To create an account, you will first need to have a wallet connected. Once that is complete, the interface will activate and you will see your funder wallet address displayed. The first step is to determine how much currency you will need to fund the account. The key decisions are how much to put into the deposit and how much to put into the balance. Signer address If you have created an Orchid signer in the Orchid app (Android-only feature labeled as \u201ccustom account creation\u201d), you can paste the public portion of the signer, the signer address, into the box. For most users, you will not have a signer keypair generated. No problem. Use the button to create the signer. Once the signer is created, the account exists in some sense, and you can now scan the QR code, or copy and paste the account into the app. It is a great idea to backup the account credentials at this time. A simple way to do that is to click the \u201cCopy\u201d button under the QR code, and then paste the account info into a password manager. NOTE: the account will have a zero balance until all three of these actions have happened: the transactions are submitted by pressing the \u201ccreate\u201d button, the transactions are approved by the attached wallet and the transactions have been confirmed by the blockchain. Efficiency slider to determine deposit size The efficiency slider shows what the payment efficiency will be for the current market conditions. The UI gathers the relevant information about the current price of the digital currencies and the amount of gas required for a provider to claim a payment, and then translates that into an efficiency metric. We recommend at least 50% efficiency, but that still means that 50% of your currency is going towards network fees. As you get into higher efficiency, the deposit size grows, but the amount paid to fees lessens. So there is a tradeoff between the total amount of money put into the deposit and the account efficiency. Because efficiency is coupled tightly with network transaction fees, it is useful to see if there is something abnormal happening with current Ethereum gas fees that could be causing the efficiencies of Orchid accounts to be rapidly changing. Size picker to determine balance size Due to the nature of the nanopayment system, the size of the balance needs some thought. Because payments are sent as probabilities of winning larger sums of money (what we call \u201clottery tickets\u201d) the balance needs to be large enough to make tickets that will be accepted by providers. Learn more about tickets here . Since the deposit is not used to pay for bandwidth, the amount of currency in your account that can be used for purchasing service is determined by the balance amount. As of now, the size of lottery tickets is half of the balance of the deposit. The size picker simply turns this into a plus and minus button, so you can pick how many tickets worth of balance you want in your account. You can always enter a number into the box as well. Our recommendation is to have a minimum of 3 tickets worth of balance. That helps even out the probabilities of the tickets over time, so that you don\u2019t experience too much variance. Add enough funds to your funder wallet Once you have used the interface to pick an efficiency and size, you will then know how much funds you will need to create the account. The amount is totaled right above the create button as \u201cTotal OXT\u201d as well as the \u201cNetwork fee ETH\u201d. You will need that amount of OXT and that amount of ETH in the funder wallet in order to enable the create account button. A current listing of exchanges where to buy OXT and ETH are listed here: https://www.orchid.com/oxt Funding the account Once there are enough funds in the attached funder wallet, the Create button will become available. Click Create! That will trigger 2 transactions to be submitted to the blockchain. The first one is an approval and will be less expensive than the second one, which is a push. Both need to successfully complete in order for the account to be usable and created properly. Both transactions will pop-up in the funder wallet and require approval, along with the payment for associated network fees. The first transaction to accept will be an approve call for the ERC-20 OXT token. This is relatively cheap, and is typically picked up fast by Ethereum. The second transaction is a push call to the Orchid nanopay contract. This is the more expensive function, and typically will require more gas and time. If your wallet supports increasing the gas limit for transactions, it is a good idea to use a higher gas limit for the second transaction so that it gets confirmed by the blockchain faster. Once the 2 transactions are approved and submitted to the blockchain, two purple banners will appear so you can keep track of the status of each transaction. Depending on the load on the current blockchain and the fees submitted with the two transactions, this can end up taking either a few minutes or many hours to complete. Blockchain tools such as Etherscan can be used to get an estimation on how long it will take. Multiple Account Management Once you have an Orchid account created, it will become selected in the interface and the UI elements will be relevant for that Orchid account. The information appearing on the Overview screen is relevant to that account, along with adding/withdrawing funds, etc. The Orchid dApp supports a single attached funder wallet to make multiple accounts. To access multiple accounts, click on the purple Orchid logo in the upper right to open the account list. From there you can create a new account and select between existing accounts. Add funds The Add Funds screen allows you to add funds to an existing account. In order to add funds to an account, the funder wallet of the account will need to be connected to the dApp interface. Clicking on Add Funds will bring up the interface. It is very similar to the account creation interface, except that the account has an existing balance and deposit. The efficiency slider and size picker will both help determine the amount of funds you need to add to the account. The total at the bottom of the interface is the amount of currency you will need in order to change the account makeup to be as selected in the interface. In addition to the currency that will be added to the balance and/or deposit, you will also need to pay the network fee. The recommendation is to have an efficiency of at least 50% and to have at least 3 tickets worth of balance. Once there is enough currency in the funder wallet, click the \u201cAdd Funds\u201d button to initiate the two transactions needed to add funds. The funder wallet needs to approve both transactions and then two purple banners will appear with the status of both of those transactions. Withdraw For the withdraw function to be available, a funder wallet will need to be connected first. The withdraw screen allows you to pull the currency out of the Balance and Deposit of the account to a wallet of your choice. If the deposit is still locked, only the balance will be able to be withdrawn. Note - if you are looking to withdraw everything from the account, the way to do this with the least amount of network fees is to unlock the Deposit and then withdraw the Balance and Deposit together. Then you only incur network fees for the unlock and withdraw, vs incurring fees for the withdraw twice. Once the Deposit is unlocked and the 24 hour cooling off period satisfied, the check box to \u201cWithdraw Full Balance and Deposit\u201d will be available. Lock/Unlock Funds The deposit of all Orchid accounts requires a 24 hour cooling off period before it can be withdrawn. The cooling off period gives enough time for providers to settle up any winning tickets they may have, and prevents double spending on the network. In order to withdraw the deposit, the deposit will first need to be unlocked using the Lock/Unlock Funds screen. Connect the funder wallet of the Orchid account to unlock and then click on the More menu in the upper right hand corner. There is a link for Lock/Unlock funds. That will open the interface. The account\u2019s deposit will either be locked or unlocked. Use the button to change the status back and forth. Note that there is a network fee for each lock and unlock. The amount of the network fee will be shown in the funder wallet after you click the lock/unlock purple button. Account info To see your Orchid Account info, go to \u2018More\u2019 and then \u2018Info\u2019. You\u2019ll see the wallet associated with the Orchid Account, and the ETH and OXT amounts in the attached wallet at the top. Below that, you\u2019ll see the Signer Key and then under \u2018Orchid Account\u2019 is your balance and deposit. At the bottom, you\u2019ll see Market Stats including minimum and recommended amounts for your balance and deposit. These numbers will fluctuate depending on the current market conditions. Finally, you\u2019ll see whether the funds in your account are locked or unlocked. Notification banners Notification banners alert you to changes related to market interactions and the Orchid network that impact your Orchid account balance and deposit. For help with specific notification messages, see Orchid account troubleshooting . Notification banners also appear when there are transactions submitted from the dApp, approved by the funder wallet and awaiting confirmation from the blockchain. Orchid DApp FAQs Why do I need a new Ethereum wallet? Why can\u2019t I use my main wallet? While you could use your primary Ethereum wallet that you typically use for other Ethereum applications, we do not recommend it if you are seeking privacy with Orchid. The main reason is that using Orchid results in on chain payments flowing from your wallet to the Orchid nanopayment contract, and then on to VPN providers selling bandwidth. Ethereum on-chain analytics can easily link payments to/from the nanopayment smart contract and then to providers. If the source of the funds comes from your personal Ethereum wallet linked to other services, anyone using Etherscan would be able to see that you used Orchid and sent payments to VPN providers, when the occasional Orchid nanopayment system issues a winning ticket. Why should I trust a big exchange with my personal info? Would a decentralized exchange that doesn\u2019t store my personal info be better? While a decentralized exchange does not store your personal information that could link your source of funds to your identity, a decentralized exchange does typically require an Ethereum account with some sort of crypto such as ETH, which has its own history of transactions. If that ETH or wallet is linked to your identity, then the source of funds could be linked through the DEX back to your originating Ethereum wallet. A large exchange typically has a ledger they use to keep track of ownership, with a hot wallet they use to send funds in and out of the exchange. While the exchange knows your identity, the movement of currency in and out of the exchange is anonymous, as the funds can\u2019t be tracked to your identity on the blockchain without the exchange being hacked, subpoenaed or otherwise compromised. Why do I need ETH and OXT? Orchid is a series of decentralized smart contracts and client software that uses Ethereum. Certain operations require the use of ETH for gas to power the smart contracts that run Orchid. For users who use the Orchid app, ETH is required when adding or removing funds from your Orchid account through the web3 browser interface.","title":"The Orchid DApp"},{"location":"orchid-dapp/#the-orchid-dapp","text":"","title":"The Orchid DApp"},{"location":"orchid-dapp/#what-is-the-orchid-dapp","text":"The Orchid dApp is a hosted front-end for users to create and manage Orchid accounts so users don\u2019t need to interact with the smart contract directly.

We recommend at least 50% efficiency, but that still means that 50% of your currency is going towards network fees. As you get into higher efficiency, the deposit size grows, but the amount paid to fees lessens. So there is a tradeoff between the total amount of money put into the deposit and the account efficiency. Because efficiency is coupled tightly with network transaction fees, it is useful to see if there is something abnormal happening with current Ethereum gas fees that could be causing the efficiencies of Orchid accounts to be rapidly changing.","title":"Efficiency slider to determine deposit size"},{"location":"orchid-dapp/#size-picker-to-determine-balance-size","text":"Due to the nature of the nanopayment system, the size of the balance needs some thought.

Both transactions will pop-up in the funder wallet and require approval, along with the payment for associated network fees. The first transaction to accept will be an approve call for the ERC-20 OXT token. This is relatively cheap, and is typically picked up fast by Ethereum. The second transaction is a push call to the Orchid nanopay contract. This is the more expensive function, and typically will require more gas and time. If your wallet supports increasing the gas limit for transactions, it is a good idea to use a higher gas limit for the second transaction so that it gets confirmed by the blockchain faster. Once the 2 transactions are approved and submitted to the blockchain, two purple banners will appear so you can keep track of the status of each transaction.

For product support, send an email to help at orchid.com. Quick Setup To get a single hop connection running ASAP, simply open the Orchid app and tap \"Get started for $1\". Confirm the $1 USD (or equivalent local currency) in-app purchase. Orchid will then fund your account on the xDAI blockchain with a 0.10 xDAI deposit and ~0.87 xDAI balance. The app will also construct a single hop circuit using the new account. After the purchase completes, hit the connect button to start the VPN. You will connect randomly to an Orchid provider after you hit the button. The provider selected is based on the amount of OXT that provider staked on the network. This is for secruity and incentive alignment. It's that easy! Home The home screen displays key pieces of information about how your device is connecting to the Internet, your account balance(s), an estimate on how many GB of service you could buy and the current average price of bandwidth. Tapping 'manage accounts' will take you to the account manager. Tapping '1 Hop Circuit' will take you to the circuit builder. The average price per GB for VPN service is displayed by polling the Chainlink oracle that averages the cost of bandwidth across the different providers in the network. Problems with your account balance, deposit or circuit will be denoted with a red !. Circuit and account display The active circuit and associated Orchid accounts that are paying for each hop are displayed in the middle of the home screen above the Manage Accounts link. Tapping on an Orchid icon will display the balance of the account. This display will denote WireGuard and OpenVPN nodes using the appropriate icons and displays the entire circuit from left to right starting with the entry hop and ending with the exit hop. To change your active circuit, tap the '1 Hop Circuit' display to go into the circuit builder. Orchid identity The hexidecimal address displayed for each hop in the circuit display is the Orchid identity associated with that account. NOTE: An Orchid identity is NOT an Ethereum wallet, even though it appears like an Ethereum wallet. Never send cryptocurrency to your Orchid identity. Doing so could cause loss of funds. An Orchid identity is your public address within the nanopayment system. When you first start the app, a new identity is created for you. You can easily create/delete/import/export identities in the account manager. You can add funds to an identity in the account manager on the xDAI chain using an in-app purchase or you can take the Orchid identity and add funds to it in the dapp. Connecting For the connect button to become available, you will need a funded account and an active circuit. If the circuit widget displays \"0 Hop Circuit\" you will need to tap on it and go into the circuit builder to create a circuit before you can connect. After tapping connect Orchid will: Display \"Orchid connecting\u201d Pause all Internet traffic on the device Call the default Ethereum RPC to access the stake-weighted random selection smart contract Check to ensure that provider is in the Curator Connect to the provider Change the status to \u201cConnected\u201d and animate the logo Note that this process can sometimes take a few dozen seconds, depending on the status of Orchid\u2019s providers. If the the process is stuck, it could be because the Orchid providers are rejecting your Orchid account or because your device is having trouble connecting to the default Ethereum RPC endpoint, and so cannot get information about the state of the provider directory. It is also possible to connect to a server, have the screen change states, and then have the connection die. Typically turning the app off/on can help kickstart the reconnect process whenever you experience no connectivity. Account manager The account manager allows you to manage multiple accounts and associated identities. It is also where you can go to export and import an accounts. The identity is displayed under \"Orchid Identity\". The funder wallet address is displayed inside the account. The identity and funder wallet together are key bits of information for each account. Learn more about Orchid's layer 2 nanopayment system: Orchid accounts . Add funds with an in-app purchase Orchid includes a system for buying \"prepaid access credits\" to connect to our list of preferred providers . Orchid VPN providers that are not part of the preferred provider system cannot accept payments in prepaid access credits, which limits the number of providers available to you when using prepaid access credits. Also Orchid manages the funder wallet for the account. Therefore the crypto purchased via in-app payments is custodial, and not available for withdaw or transfer by the user. The add funds option is available on iOS/macOS and Android. You will need a valid form of payment attached to your Apple or Google account associated with the phone to make the in-app purchase. The fiat amount of the in-app payment will be denominated in your local currency. The purchase will convert the amount to xDAI and fund the selected identity on the xDai blockchain. The xDai chain is a stable payments blockchain designed for fast and inexpensive transactions. Orchid accounts created on xDai are viewable using the BlockScout Explorer . Learn more about xDai . When using the \"Get started for $1\" quick start, you will fund the account for $1. From the account manager you can add funds in three different preset amounts: $1, $5 and $20 which is more appropriate for topping up an account when funds run low. Note that there is no significant advantage in terms of pricing for purchasing a larger account. Orchid is simply converting your fiat to the xDAI stablecoin and placing those funds on-chain in your selected account. The average price per GB across the network is denoted on the homescreen and varies from provider to provider. Add funds with the dapp To fund an account yourself you will need a wallet (we primarily test with Metamask's Chrome plug-in ) and the appropriate funds for the blockchain that you want to house the account. For example, OXT on Ethereum. You will also need enough cyrpto to pay for the gas fees associated with executing the nanopayment contract. Note: Do not transfer OXT to your Orchid identity! That will not work. You will need to use the Orchid dapp in order to manage your on-chain funds yourself. All transactions using the dapp including funding/unlocking/withdrawing fund the account will require the user to pay for network fees on the blockchain that houses the account. Before you can use the Orchid dapp, you will also need an Orchid identity that you intend to fund. From the account manager you can tap on the hexidecimal string under Orchid Identity to copy the identity to your clipboard. Paste this information into the Identity field in the dApp to manage that account. Learn more about how to create an account in the Orchid dApp. Importing accounts To import existing Orchid accounts, tap manage accounts -> cog wheel -> import to bring up the interface to either scan the QR code or paste in the text of an exported identity. That will import all the accounts associated with that account's identity and make them available. Exporting accounts To export your selected Orchid account, tap the cog wheel in the upper right and then 'export'. You will then get a QR code of the key and a copy button that will copy the key into your clipboard. With the key, the funds in the Orchid account can be spent or extracted. It is a good practice to save the key in your password manager or to store it somewhere safe. The best practice for storing all the relevant details of an Orchid account is to save the funding wallet as a username and the raw key as the password in a password manager. Circuit builder Orchid is the only multi-hop VPN application that allows you to make an \"onion route\" through multiple independent VPN servers with layered encryption between each node. This screen allows you to manage the VPN server connections that form your circuit. A single hop circuit is similar to a typical VPN provider. Three hops is a standard \"onion route\". For more information about the implications of multiple hops, refer to the FAQ section on Security . Tap on the Add New Hop button to add a hop. Swipe a hop to the left or right to delete the hop. Long press on a hop to move it up or down in the circuit. The entry node is at the top of the screen and the exit node is at the bottom. While Orchid accounts are stored in the account manager, there is no way to store OpenVPN or WireGuard hops except by adding them to your active circuit. See below on how to save your circuit and export the entire configuration, which could help you manage inactive OpenVPN or WireGuard hops. Orchid hop Orchid hops are not a single specific server, but are rather defined as an Orchid account that will pay for a randomized node picked from the stake weighted random directory. When you connect, the app runs through the directory and gets back a server to use in the circuit. The randomness is an important part of Orchid. For detailed information on stake-weighted random selection and why it matters, read section 4.4 of the Orchid whitepaper . To add an Orchid node you will need to first select the identity of the payment account and then select the funding wallet. The Orchid identity and funding wallet are two key pieces of information that define an Orchid account. The app scans blockchains using RPC servers for active accounts. If account detection fails, it is possible to paste in the funding wallet address if you are certain WireGuard Orchid supports WireGuard. When you add a WireGuard server to your circuit, Orchid will connect to that specific WireGuard server. Tap Add a Hop and then paste in your WireGuard configuration file and hit save. OpenVPN Orchid supports OpenVPN. Tap Add a Hop and then put in the information for that OpenVPN server. OpenVPN configuration files can vary from VPN provider to VPN provider. We don't know if all configurations work; please email us at help at orchid dot com for support or to let us know what is working or not working for you. We appreciate your help! Here are some items to note and check: Orchid uses OpenVPN3 without command line flags user/pwd is provided when adding the config. If your config contains auth-user-pass then try adding client-cert-not-required on a newline try removing arguments to auth-user-pass Saving your circuit For Orchid hops, the app stores Orchid account information from the account manager. Deleting an Orchid hop doesn't destroy any information. For WireGuard and OpenVPN, there is no way to save each specific hop at this time. If you delete either type of hop, the config information that you entered will be deleted. One mechanism to save this information is to export your entire circuit configuration. You can save this as text and then re-add it later. While not perfect, this method will let you save circuits by exporting them. To export and import a circuit, go to the hamburger menu -> settings -> manage configuration -> export and save the text. Traffic analyzer Orchid has a built-in traffic monitor that can run with or without an Orchid account (it's a free feature!). Using the traffic monitor is similar to WireShark--and Orchid works on iOS! The traffic monitor also works across every platform that Orchid supports: iOS, macOS and Android. To enable the traffic analyzer and review your devices connections, top on the traffic light icon in the upper right of the homescreen or tap the hamburger menu -> traffic analyzer. Traffic filters The traffic analyzer supports different ways to filter the traffic to better make sense of the connections your phone is making. Enter a hostname or partial hostname into the search bar to show only matching rows. Enter multiple terms separated by a space to combine hostname filters using \u201cAND\u201d logic. e.g. \u201cgoog api\u201d will match rows including both \u201cgoog\u201d and \u201capi\u201d, such as \u201capi1.google.com\u201d. Use a \u201c-\u201d minus sign to exclude terms. e.g. \u201c-goog\u201d will show all hostnames except those matching \u201cgoog\u201d. You can mix these to include and exclude combinations such as: \u201cgoogle -api\u201d to find all \u201cgoogle\u201d entries excluding those with \u201capi\u201d. Use \u201cprot: \u201dto filter by protocol name. e.g. \u201cprot:imap\u201d will match all traffic identified as \u201cimap\u201d connections and \u201c-prot:dns\u201d will filter out all DNS queries from the results. Settings From the homescreen, swipe right or tap the hamburger menu in the top left. From there you can navigate to all the screens in the app, get in-app help, read the privacy policy, open source license and version number on the bottom. For settings, tap Settings. Default Curator Orchid uses an on-chain curated list which filters the viable nodes to a custom subset called a curator. Orchid's official curator is partners.orch1d.eth . The Orchid client uses this list to prevent certain kinds of attacks from malicious exit nodes (e.g. SSL downgrade attacks) by using a default list with trusted VPN partners. The curator is set for each Orchid hop. This setting is the default that will appear with you add a hop. By leaving this blank, you will remove curation and accept a connection to any provider you connect with in the directory. The curation system is open and it is possible for anyone to make a curated list. Query balances Orchid uses access to RPC endpoints in order to get information about account balances. If you do not want Orchid to connect to RPC endpoints for security reasons, turn off query balances. Advanced configuration: Ethereum RPC The advanced configuration box is where you can input custom commands into the client. Mainly this is used for testing purposes, however there are some user facing commands that are useful. One of the most useful settings is the Ethereum RPC endpoint. For Orchid to connect, the app needs to access the Ethereum blockchain to access the stake weighted directory in order to find a provider. The default RPC uses Alchemy . You can overide the default Ethereum with rpc='<URL to ETH Endpoint>' (no ; or other characters). There are many ways to get access to the latest state of the Ethereum blockchain: Cloudflare runs a public endpoint. To connect add this line: rpc='https://cloudflare-eth.com' with no ; or extra spaces You can run your own Ethereum node using GETH , enable the RPC endpoint and then set the `rpc=' ' Infura offers free Ethereum endpoints after you register for an account POKT Network offers a free Ethereum endpoint after you register for an account Note that both POKT and Infura will require an account. After you register, they will provide a unique URL that you can use in the advanced configuration. Without a functioning Ethereum endpoint, Orchid will not connect. When troubleshooting, use a browser to test and see if certain domains are blocked, such as Alchemy.com. If your browser cannot open Alchemy.com, then it is probably blocked in your region and you will need to find an alternative Ethereum RPC to connect. Configuration management The configuration management screen is a way to export and import all of the accounts currently on the app along with the current active circuit. This is very useful for backing up all your accounts and current application state. Note: the keys to your Orchid account(s) will be exposed when you export your configuration. Use caution when exporting and do not store your keys in plaintext. Active circuit : the active circuit contains all the information sent to the backend vpn tunnel to form the multi-hop route. For OpenVPN and WireGuard hops, the account information and details to connect to that VPN node is encoded. For each Orchid hop, there is a curator, the public address of the funding wallet, the Orchid account private key, chainid of where the account is housed, the currency and the RPC endpoint for accessing information on the blockchain where hops = [{protocol: \"orch1d\", curator: \"partners.orch1d.eth\", funder: \"<public address of funder wallet>\", secret: \"<Orchid account key>\", chainid: 100, currency: \"DAI\", rpc=\"https://rpc.xdaichain.com/\"}]; protocol : the VPN tunnel protocol. Either \"orch1d\" for Orchid, \"openvpn\" for OpenVPN or \"wireguard\" for WireGaurd curator : for Orchid hops, this is the curator for this hop funder : the public address of the Ethereum wallet that created the account using the dapp. For xDAI accounts associated with the pre-paid access credit system, this address will be the custody wallet run by Orchid secret : the key of the Orchid account. Accessible from the account manager -> gear icon -> export chainid : the chainid of where the account is stored currency : the currency of the account balance and deposit rpc : the RPC endpoint used to look up account information on that chain Windows Beta Note: this is an early beta release that requires some effort on the command line in addition to manually editing files and installing a driver.

Android Prerequisites Start by turning on developer and debugging mode on the phone by going to Settings -> About Phone -> About Software and tapping on the build number repeatedly until it prompts you to enable developer mode. Then go to Settings -> Developer Settings -> Turn on USB Debugging . Finally, you can run the following command on your computer with your phone connected via USB to view the logs. Android and iOS Prerequisites When you connect your device to your computer, it will prompt you to trust the computer. It is important that you do so. Otherwise, you will be unable to collect logs. Cydia Impactor The easiest way to gather logs from both iOS and Android devices is through Cydia Impactor . In the main window, use the select box to pick the correct device (if you only have one mobile device connected to your computer, this will be done for you). Next, go to Device -> Watch Log... . A terminal window will appear and it will start to show a streaming syslog from your mobile device. adb logcat (Android) If you are using an Android device, you can alternatively collect logs through the Android Debug Bridge (ADB). You can follow this guide to install adb on Windows, macOS, or Linux. Once installed, you can run the following command in a terminal to view the logs: adb logcat Sanitizing the Logs The logs you gather will contain information from all applications and actions taken on your device during the period that logs are being gathered. These are not all necessary for debugging purposes. You can optionally filter out all lines that do not contain the string orchid as a quick way to sanitize the output. You can do this with a command like: grep -i 'orchid' client.log Where client.log is the file containing the syslog output from the device. You should also be careful to filter out your various secret keys from the logs: grep -vi 'secret' client.log Sharing the Logs The logs you gather will be quite long. You almost certainly do not want to paste them in their entirety into something like a Telegram message. Instead, we encourage you to either share them as an attachment via your preferred method of communication. Or if you are using a communication platform that doesn't support attachments, you can utilize a private pastebin service such as GitHub Gists , which will provide you with a secret URL you can share to grant access to your logs.
